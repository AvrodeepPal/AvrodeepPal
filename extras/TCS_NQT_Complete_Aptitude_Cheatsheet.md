# FOUNDATION SECTIONS (20 Questions Each, 25 Min Per Section)

## 🔢 FOUNDATION NUMERICAL ABILITY

### ⚡ Quick Shortcuts by Topic

#### **1. SIMPLIFICATION (Very Common - 2-3 Questions)**
**Shortcut:** BODMAS/PEMDAS - Bracket → Order → Division/Multiplication → Addition/Subtraction

**Example:**
```
Q: 24 ÷ 6 × 3 + 2 - 1 = ?
Method: 4 × 3 + 2 - 1 = 12 + 2 - 1 = 13 ✓
```

**High-Prediction Topics:**
- Mixed operations with fractions
- Decimal simplifications
- Percentage in formulas

**Tricks:**
- Work left to right for same priority operations
- Convert decimals to fractions for easier calculation
- Use approximation when answer choices are far apart

**Time Goal:** 30-60 seconds per question

---

#### **2. TIME & WORK (Frequently Asked - 2-3 Questions)**

**Main Formula:** Work = Rate × Time OR W = 1/(Time to complete)

**When A & B work together:**
```
Combined Rate = 1/a + 1/b
Time taken together = (a × b)/(a + b)
```

**High-Prediction Variations:**
- Both work together then one leaves
- Work completed at different rates
- Capacity/efficiency changes

**Example:**
```
Q: A can do work in 10 days, B in 15 days. How long together?
Answer: (10 × 15)/(10 + 15) = 150/25 = 6 days ✓

Quick Trick: If A:B ratio is 10:15 = 2:3
Combined work in 1 day = 1/10 + 1/15 = (3+2)/30 = 5/30 = 1/6
So 6 days total ✓
```

**Common Traps:**
- Question says "remaining work" (read carefully)
- Efficiency changes mid-problem
- Different time units (hours vs days)

**Time Goal:** 1-1.5 minutes per question

---

#### **3. PIPES & CISTERNS (Same as Time & Work - 2 Questions)**

**Key Difference:** Inlet(+), Outlet(-), Both(-) when draining

**Formula:**
```
Part filled = Inlet rate × Time - Outlet rate × Time
If net = 1/8 per hour, time = 8 hours
```

**High-Prediction Scenarios:**
- Multiple inlets/outlets
- Different sized pipes
- Pipe opened/closed mid-process

**Trick:** Convert to LCM-based capacity method

**Time Goal:** 1.5 minutes per question

---

#### **4. PERCENTAGE (Most Frequent - 2-3 Questions)**

**Convert to Fractions for Speed:**
```
12.5% = 1/8
16.67% = 1/6
20% = 1/5
25% = 1/4
33.33% = 1/3
50% = 1/2
66.67% = 2/3
```

**Successive Percentage Change:**
```
If increase a% then b%:
Final = Original × (1 + a/100) × (1 + b/100)
Quick: a + b + ab/100 percentage change
```

**High-Prediction Questions:**
- Percentage increase/decrease calculation
- Profit/loss percentage with cost price
- Population growth problems
- Discount chain problems

**Example:**
```
Q: 25% discount on marked price of ₹1000, then 20% more discount. Final price?
Wrong: 1000 - 250 - 200 = 550
Correct: 1000 × 0.75 × 0.80 = 600 ✓

Quick: 25 + 20 - (25×20/100) = 40% total discount
```

**Time Goal:** 60-90 seconds

---

#### **5. PROFIT & LOSS (Common - 1-2 Questions)**

**Basic Formulas:**
```
Profit% = (SP - CP)/CP × 100
Loss% = (CP - SP)/CP × 100
SP = CP + Profit (or SP = CP - Loss)
```

**High-Prediction Scenarios:**
- Cost price finding from profit%
- Multiple item transactions
- Marked price vs selling price

**Trick:** When two items sold at same price
```
If CP1=a, CP2=b, both sold at same price P:
Profit% on item1 and loss% on item2
Result typically loss (use harmonic mean)
```

**Time Goal:** 60-90 seconds

---

#### **6. SIMPLE & COMPOUND INTEREST (1-2 Questions)**

**Simple Interest:** SI = (P × R × T)/100

**Compound Interest:** A = P(1 + R/100)^T, CI = A - P

**Fast Track:**
```
CI for 2 years = P × R × (200 + R)/10000

Example: P=1000, R=10%, T=2
CI = 1000 × 10 × 210/10000 = 210 ✓
```

**High-Prediction Questions:**
- Difference between CI & SI
- Quarterly/Half-yearly compounding
- Finding rate or time

**Approximation Trick (Small %):**
```
For small R and small T:
CI ≈ SI + (SI × R × T)/(100 × 100)
```

**Time Goal:** 90 seconds

- Three-quantity ratio problems
- Mixture problems with multiple items
- Partition problems

**Time Goal:** 60-90 seconds

---

#### **8. SPEED, TIME & DISTANCE (1-2 Questions)**

**Basic:** Speed = Distance/Time

**Unit Conversion:**
```
km/hr to m/s: multiply by 5/18
m/s to km/hr: multiply by 18/5
```

**Relative Speed:**
```
Same direction: |S1 - S2|
Opposite direction: S1 + S2
Time to meet = Distance/(Relative Speed)
```

**High-Prediction Questions:**
- Two objects moving toward/away each other
- Boat in river (upstream/downstream)
- Average speed calculations

**Boat Trick:**
```
Upstream: (Speed in still water - River flow)
Downstream: (Speed in still water + River flow)

Average = (2 × Upstream × Downstream)/(Upstream + Downstream)
```

**Time Goal:** 90 seconds

---

#### **9. PROBABILITY (1 Question - Frequently Asked)**

**Basic:** P(E) = Favorable outcomes / Total outcomes

**Card Problems (52 cards, 4 suits):**
```
P(specific card) = 1/52
P(red card) = 26/52 = 1/2
P(face card) = 12/52 = 3/13
```

**Dice (1 die):**
```
Total outcomes = 6
P(even) = 3/6 = 1/2
P(number > 3) = 3/6 = 1/2
```

**High-Prediction Topics:**
- Dependent vs independent events
- P(A and B) = P(A) × P(B)
- P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)

**Complement:** P(not E) = 1 - P(E)

**Time Goal:** 60 seconds

nPr = n!/(n-r)! [order matters - arrangements]
nCr = n!/[r!(n-r)!] [order doesn't matter - selections]

nCr = nC(n-r) [quick calculation]
nPr = nCr × r! [relationship between both]
```

**High-Prediction Scenarios:**
- Committee formation with restrictions
- Arrangement of letters/words
- Selection with/without repetition

**Example:**
```
Q: In how many ways can 5 people sit in a line?
Answer: 5P5 = 5! = 120 ✓

Q: How many ways to select 3 from 5 people?
Answer: 5C3 = 10 ✓

Q: Select 3 from 5 people AND arrange them in 2 seats?

```

**Circular Arrangement:**
```
Linear: n! arrangements
Circular: (n-1)! arrangements
Necklace (both directions): (n-1)!/2

Reason: Fix one position to eliminate rotations
```

**Time Goal:** 2-3 minutes for 2-3 questions

---

#### **2. PROBABILITY WITH MULTIPLE EVENTS (2-3 Questions)**

**Advanced Scenarios:**

**Independent Events:**
```
P(A and B) = P(A) × P(B)

Example: Coin + Dice
P(Heads AND 4) = 1/2 × 1/6 = 1/12
```

**Dependent Events:**
```
P(A then B | A happened) = different probability
P(B|A) = P(A and B)/P(A)

Example: Drawing 2 cards without replacement
1st card red: 26/52
2nd card red (1st was red): 25/51
Both red: 26/52 × 25/51
```

**Mutually Exclusive:**
```
P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) [if cannot happen together]

Example: Rolling even or odd on one die
P(Even or Odd) = 3/6 + 3/6 = 1 ✓
```

**Not Mutually Exclusive:**
```
P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)

Example: Drawing red or face card
P = 26/52 + 12/52 - 6/52 = 32/52 = 8/13
```

**Conditional Probability:**
```
P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B)/P(B)

Example: P(sick|positive test) = needs formula application
```

**Time Goal:** 2-3 minutes total

---

#### **3. DATA INTERPRETATION (3-4 Questions)**

**Question Types:**
- Pie chart → percentage/angle calculations
- Bar chart → comparison & calculation
- Table → sorting & filtering
- Line graph → trend analysis

**High-Prediction Calculations:**
- Percentage increase/decrease
- Average calculations
- Ratio comparisons
- Profit/loss percentages

**Trick:**
- Don't calculate exact value, estimate
- Use approximation to eliminate options
- Check units (per 1000, in percentage, etc.)

**Example:**
```
Pie chart shows 45% profit in 2023
If total profit = ₹50 Crore
What is 2023 profit?
= 50 × 45/100 = ₹22.5 Crore

Quick: If options are far apart (₹20Cr, ₹50Cr, ₹80Cr)
Estimation: ~45% of 50 = ~22.5, close to ₹20Cr ✓
```

**Time Goal:** 1-1.5 minutes per question

#### **2. ADVANCED PUZZLE LOGIC (1-2 Questions)**

**Multi-level Logic:**
```
Attributes: Name, Color, Age, Hobby, etc.
Clues connect attributes (e.g., Red car owner plays chess)
Find complete mapping of all attributes

Process:
- Draw table with all combinations
- Mark ✓ for confirmed, ✗ for ruled out
- Use elimination
```

**Time Goal:** 3-5 minutes

---

#### **3. COMPLEX SYLLOGISM & VENN (2-3 Questions)**

**Advanced Scenarios:**
- 4+ statements to analyze
- Mix of universal & particular
- Negative statements
- Multiple possible conclusions

**Trick:** Venn diagram gets complex, draw carefully

**Time Goal:** 2-3 minutes total

- Complex tense combinations
- Dangling modifiers

**Example:**
```
Wrong: "Running to the station, my train was missed."
(Subject changed mid-sentence)

Correct: "Running to the station, I missed my train."
(Gerund subject = main clause subject)
```

**Time Goal:** 60-90 seconds

---

#### **3. ADVANCED VOCABULARY & CONTEXT (1-2 Questions)**

**Words with Multiple Meanings:**
```
"Bank" = Financial institution OR river edge
Context: "The bank of the river" = river edge
```

**Subtle Synonym Differences:**
```
"Frugal" ≠ "Stingy" (same outcome, different motivation)
"Benevolent" ≠ "Merciful" (subtle difference)
```

**Time Goal:** 45-60 seconds
